# Covid-19-SQL-Data-Exploration

Skills Used:

Joins: Utilized to combine data from multiple tables, such as merging COVID-19 vaccination and death data based on location and date.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Employed to create temporary result sets for complex queries, enhancing readability and manageability.
Window Functions: Applied for advanced analytics, including calculating moving averages, cumulative sums, and identifying top N records within each group.
Aggregate Functions: Used for summarizing data, calculating totals, averages, counts, etc., essential for deriving insights from large datasets.
Filtering and Sorting: Implemented to narrow down the dataset based on specific criteria and to arrange data in a meaningful order for analysis.
Creating Views: Utilized to encapsulate complex queries into reusable objects, promoting code reusability and simplifying data access.
Converting Data Types: Necessary for ensuring compatibility and consistency in data manipulation and analysis operations.
Project Overview:
This repository contains SQL scripts for exploring COVID-19 related data. The data includes information on vaccinations, deaths, and other relevant metrics across various locations and dates.

Files Included:

Covid-19 Data Exploration.sql: Contains SQL scripts demonstrating the application of various exploration techniques, including joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, filtering, sorting, creating views, and data type conversion.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, details on the skills utilized, and instructions for executing the scripts.
Instructions:

Ensure that you have access to a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
Execute the SQL scripts provided in the "Data_Exploration_Scripts.sql" file in your SQL environment to explore the COVID-19 data.
Refer to the comments within the scripts for guidance on each exploration technique and its application.
Modify the scripts as needed to adapt to your specific data analysis requirements or dataset structure.
Note: Before executing the scripts, ensure that you have appropriate permissions to access and modify the database tables referenced in the queries.
